## 👋 About Us

**SCTY** is a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) design and technology studio founded by **Ali Madad** in NYC. We collaborate with teams, brands, and organizations to create desirable futures through systems, storytelling, and strategic innovations.

We help teams navigate the AI transformation journey—from strategy development to organizational integration to shipping AI products—all while augmenting (not replacing) human creativity.

### 🎯 Our Approach

We move from research, concept, and prototype **(0 → 1)** to strategy, incubation, and launch **(1 → N)**, working across:

- 🧬 **Brand Systems** — Living identities that adapt and evolve
- 🎨 **Product Design** — AI-native experiences that users love
- 🚀 **Digital Transformation** — Embedding AI into how organizations work
- 💡 **Strategic Innovation** — Cutting through hype to deliver real value

---

## 🛠️ What We Do

We help teams use AI to solve real problems and grow faster through four key offerings:

### 🔭 Vision Sprint
**"Where should we play?"**

For leaders struggling to identify which AI opportunities will drive real business value. Cut through the hype and develop a focused strategy with clear priorities and measurable outcomes.

### 🧪 Maker Lab
**"How do we start today?"**

For teams overwhelmed by the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Break through analysis paralysis with hands-on experimentation that builds confidence and practical skills.

### 🔄 Transformation Program
**"Embed AI into the org."**

For organizations where siloed AI initiatives fail to scale. Transform disconnected efforts into a cohesive strategy that changes how your entire organization works.

### 🚀 Product Incubator
**"Ship an AI product."**

For product teams struggling to move from AI concepts to market-ready solutions. Navigate technical complexity and market uncertainty to launch differentiated AI products that users love.
