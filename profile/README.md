## About

**SCTY** is a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) design and technology studio founded by **Ali Madad** in NYC. We collaborate with teams, brands, and organizations to create desirable futures through systems, storytelling, and strategic innovation.

We help teams navigate the AI transformation journey—from strategy development to organizational integration to shipping AI products—while augmenting, not replacing, human creativity.

### Our Approach

We move from research, concept, and prototype **(0 → 1)** to strategy, incubation, and launch **(1 → N)**, working across:

- **Brand Systems** — Living identities that adapt and evolve  
- **Product Design** — AI-native experiences that users love  
- **Digital Transformation** — Embedding AI into how organizations work  
- **Strategic Innovation** — Cutting through hype to deliver real value

## Philosophy

### AI Native Intelligence  
We reimagine experiences from the ground up with AI as a foundational capability.

### Systems Thinking  
We design systems, not just screens—solutions that scale, adapt, and evolve.

### Ship Fast, Learn Faster  
We prototype rapidly, gather feedback, and iterate.

### Human + AI  
We augment human creativity with AI to create outcomes neither could achieve alone.

### Build in Public  
We share our learnings, open-source our tools, and contribute to the community.
